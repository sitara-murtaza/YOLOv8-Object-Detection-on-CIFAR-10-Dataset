# YOLOv8-Object-Detection-on-CIFAR-10-Dataset
This project integrates YOLOv8 Nano with the CIFAR-10 dataset to perform object detection. CIFAR images are resized for clarity, converted to OpenCV format, and passed to YOLOv8. For each class, multiple images are processed and displayed with annotated detections, showcasing YOLO’s capability on small, low-res dataset images.
